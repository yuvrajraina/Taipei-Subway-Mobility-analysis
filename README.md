# Taipei-Subway-Mobility-analysis
The purpose of the task is to classify days over years 2017-2018 by their corresponding mobility patterns between 10 zones in Taipei (quantified by an aggregated temporal network of subway ridership flows across the city)

We train a neural network against the categorical label to find which day it is
